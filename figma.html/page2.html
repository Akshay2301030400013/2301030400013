            <h2>The Greedy Fox</h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time, in a quiet forest, there lived a very greedy fox. He was always looking for food, even when he wasn’t hungry. One sunny day, while walking through the forest, the fox smelled something delicious. 
                Following the smell, he found a farmer’s kitchen with a big loaf of bread, some meat, and a jar of honey sitting on the windowsill.
                <br><br>
                The fox’s mouth watered. "What a feast!" he thought. He waited until the farmer went inside and quickly snuck up to grab the food. He ate the bread, gulped down the meat, and licked the honey until the jar was empty. 
                "I feel so full," he said, patting his belly. But he still wanted more!
                <br><br>
                The fox spotted a narrow hole in the farmer’s fence and squeezed through it to explore the farm further. On the other side, he found a big basket of fruits. He thought, "I can’t leave this behind!" Even though his stomach was already full, he began eating the fruits.
                <br><br>
                After a while, his belly grew so big that when he tried to squeeze back through the fence, he got stuck! He wriggled and squirmed, but it was no use. The greedy fox had eaten too much.
                <br><br>
                The farmer heard the commotion and came out. When he saw the fox stuck in the fence, he laughed and said, "Greed always gets you into trouble!" The farmer freed the fox, but not before giving him a good lesson on being greedy.
                The fox waddled back to the forest, promising never to be greedy again. From that day on, the fox learned to eat only what he needed.
